# LinkD

This repository contains a minimal LinkedIn-style demo built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and the Expo Router. The application provides a simple login screen and two main tabs: a feed of posts and a basic profile page.

## Running the app

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install --prefix linkD
   ```

2. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npx expo start --working-directory linkD
   ```

Open the web preview from the Expo CLI to interact with the demo.
